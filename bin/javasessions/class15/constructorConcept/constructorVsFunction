constructor Vs function
=======================
constructor looks like a function but its not a function
=======================
constructor name is the name of the class but a function name could be anything
=======================
constructor cannot return anything but a function may or may not return
=======================
avoid business logic in the constructor but function should have the business logic
=======================
constructor is used to initialize the class/instance variable with the local variables using this keyword
this can also be done in functions using encapsulation
=======================
constructor can be overloaded and so can functions
=======================
constructor will be called automatically when the object of the class is created but function will be called
using the object reference name incase of non static methods and using classname.method() incase of static methods
=======================
constructor helps in object creation, function does restrict in the creation of objects of a class
=======================
